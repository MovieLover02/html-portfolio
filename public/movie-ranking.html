<h1>Movies You Have to Watch According to Me</h1>
<h2>Excellent films everyone should watch at least once.</h2>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Probably the best movie trilogy ever made (in my opinion).</p>

<h3>Inglourious Basterds</h3>
<p>One of my favorite Tarantino films.</p>

<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>Not for everyone but I absolutely loved it.</p>
